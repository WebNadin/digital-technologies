 You could see here an example of simple landing page with header, several background images and parallax animation
 for some of them. Also there are initial animation for images(GSAP) and different hover effects for all links and
 buttons.

 In this project I mastered:
 - GSAP
 - parallax animation
 - creating new CSS animations
